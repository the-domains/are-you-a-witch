In\nDecember 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by\nhis foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.\n\nIn the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type,\nmost of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed\nto solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was\nconceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end\ndecided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became\navailable for a public
