# There are three main sections 

Due to the growing interest in all things Magick, the first will look at identifying what makes a witch, what is witchcraft and what is magick. 

The second section will look at the way in which you can start opening a path in your life to decide whether you want to become a witch

Or follow another path.

I see each path out there as leading to the same place but using different languages, a different set of tools and traveling through a different landscape.
