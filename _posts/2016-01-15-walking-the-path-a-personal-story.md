Walking the Path, a personal story.

The worst thing that can happen to a person with extrasensory perceptions, powers of observation higher than those of "normal" humans, or a seeking mind way too active for the comfort of those around them, is to live in ignorance of his or her condition. When this happens he or she can end up within the walls of a psychiatric hospital at worst, and feeling confused, misunderstood, depressed, becoming easy prey to cults and manipulators at best.
