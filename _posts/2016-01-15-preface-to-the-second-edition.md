Preface to the Second Edition.

When I first wrote this book over a decade ago, there was not as much information about our awakening capacities out there than there is today. The book was a response to the inevitable misunderstandings that started to be reflected on popular TV shows and books with regard to the link between witches (something that was seen either as extremely negative, or "cool"), and our natural extrasensory perceptions and skills.

Now there is a lot more information regarding these abilities, but there is still a lot of misinformation about their nature and "who" has them or uses them. The word "witch" is still fully charged with programs, fears, and negative connotations. And anyone with special skills is portrayed in movies as being perceived as dangerous, persecuted and often killed.

In this second edition, I have reviewed some of the information, have added more accounts and experiences which have come up since the first edition was first published.

This book developed from a short article I published on the Internet in the late 1990s by the name of "Are you a Witch?" The original article was in Spanish and people copied it into various web pages as a free resource under the name "Â¿Eres Bruja?"

Thousands of emails were sent asking for more information, this book is in answer to those emails.

The information contained within is true for me from what I have experienced and observed and in no way claims to anything but that.

I invite you to share that exploration and use it as you will.
