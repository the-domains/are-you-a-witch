            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Preface to the Second Edition.</h1><p>When I first wrote this book over a decade ago, there was not as much information about our awakening capacities out there than there is today. The book was a response to the inevitable misunderstandings that started to be reflected on popular TV shows and books with regard to the link between witches (something that was seen either as extremely negative, or “cool”), and our natural extrasensory perceptions and skills.</p></article>]]></description>

When this happens he or she can end up within the walls of a psychiatric hospital at worst, and feeling confused, misunderstood, depressed, becoming easy prey to cults and manipulators at best.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some years back I had to visit a person who had been committed in a psychiatric hospital due to what the doctors called a depressive disorder. While I was chatting to him in the common room I felt a presence behind me, I turned to see a young and beautiful woman, she must have been around nineteen years old at the time. She entered the room accompanied by several other patients, chatting and smoking they walked passed and sat a little way from us.</p>]]></description>
